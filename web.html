    <h1>CORONA SECOND WAVE</h1>

    <p><embed> During the second wave in India, many cases of mucormycosis, also known as the black fungus, have been reported in patients with diabetes and patients with COVID-19, as well as patients who were recovering from infection. The excessive use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 and immunosuppression by the virus led to the emergence of this opportunistic fungal infection.5 Although cases of black fungus were reported during the first wave, cases during the second wave have become more prominent in many cities of India, leading state governments to declare this too as an epidemic. As of June 7, 2021, the Indian Ministry of Health had recorded 28 252 cases of black fungus. The risk of the white fungus Aspergillosis—assumed to be even more fatal than the black fungus—is also on the rise with some cases reported in parts of India.6
        Patients in the first wave infected with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly older than 60 years and those with comorbid conditions were at increased risk of death. However, surprisingly, younger adults appear to be prone to infection during this latest cycle and many patients have died at a young age, including patients aged between 25 and 50 years.7

        <p><em>In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was "in the endgame" of the Covid-19 pandemic.

            Mr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an "example to the world in international co-operation". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted "vaccine diplomacy".
            
            Mr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100.
            
            The euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was "bending the Covid infection curve". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was "breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight". Mr Modi was called a "vaccine guru".

<p>According to the IMA, 748 doctors died in the first wave of the pandemic.

    "Last year 748 doctors across India succumbed to COVID-19, while in the current second wave, in a short period we have lost 730 doctors," a doctor associated with the IMA said.
    
    Recently, the IMA had also said that eight pregnant doctors lost their lives during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic</p>

<h4>VACCINATION</h4>
<img src="vaccination.jpeg"width="200px"height="50px">
        <P>Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development. WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. 

            Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds. 
            
            Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.
